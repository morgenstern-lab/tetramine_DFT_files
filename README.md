DFT calculation files for 2026 publication: DFT and Mass Spectrometry Study of (–)ESI Induced Fragmentation of the Highly Toxic Rodenticide Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine

All calculations used Amsterdam Modeling Suite. Some run files include a header from running on an HPC cluster with Slurm. The following files are included in various branches:
1. Condended Phase Mechanism - lowest energy pathway corresponding to Figure 1, Schemes a and b, for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
2. Gas Phase Mechanism - lowest energy pathway corresponding to Scheme S1 for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
3. Reactant Molecule Stability - QTAIM, IQA, and fragment energy calculations for 7 heteroadamantanes
4. Intermediate 1 Stability - QTAIM calculations for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
5. Intermediate 2 Stability - QTAIM, IQA, and fragment energy calculations for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
