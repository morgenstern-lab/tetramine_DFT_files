DFT calculation files for 2025 publication: Elucidating the Mechanistic Pathway of (â€“)ESI-Induced Fragmentation of the Highly Toxic Rodenticide Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine: A Theoretical and Experimental Approach

All calculations used Amsterdam Modeling Suite. Some run files include a header from running on an HPC cluster with Slurm. Files are organized in the following directories:
1. Condended Phase Mechanism - lowest energy pathway corresponding to Figure 1, Schemes a and b, for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
2. Gas Phase Mechanism - lowest energy pathway corresponding to Scheme S1 for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
3. Other Attemped Mechanisms - higher energy pathways for gas and condensed phases
4. Reactant Molecule Stability - QTAIM, IQA, and fragment energy calculations for 7 heteroadamantanes
5. Intermediate 1 Stability - QTAIM calculations for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
6. Intermediate 2 Stability - QTAIM, IQA, and fragment energy calculations for HMT, TETS, and HEXS
